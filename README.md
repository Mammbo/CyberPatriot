# CyberPatriot

Scripts and checklists for use in CyberPatriot.

## Use

Go to the relevant folder for your image.
Inside will be a `README.md` file with a checklist as well as a script to automate some tasks.
The checklist will differentiate between things that are managed by the script and things that are not.

> **Note**  
> Before running any scripts, **do the forensics questions!**
> It's possible if not likely that a script will mess with something
> required to answer a forensics question, such as deleting a user or group.

## Contributing

Contributions in the form of issues or PR's/MR's for either checklists or scripts are appreciated!
I prefer GitLab for these since it's where the [main repository](https://gitlab.com/MysteryBlokHed/cyberpatriot/)
is hosted, but I'll still look at things on GitHub.
