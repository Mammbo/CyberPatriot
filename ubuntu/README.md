## Not Managed By Script

- [ ] Enable auto-updates **through Ubuntu's UI**
  1. Run the Software Updater
  2. Go to Settings
  3. To be continued (I don't have an Ubuntu machine at the time of writing this)
- [ ] Add missing groups

       If the browser is Firefox, basically just set every setting
