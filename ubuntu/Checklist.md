# Ubuntu Checklist

## Managed by script

- [ ] Run updates
- [ ] Enable & configure UFW
- [ ] Configure sshd (enable, disable root login, etc.)
- [ ] Remove unauthorized users
- [ ] Add/remove users from sudo group

## Not managed by script

- [ ] Enable auto-updates
  1. Run the Software Updater
  2. Go to Settings
  3. To be continued (I don't have an Ubuntu machine at the time of writing this)
- [ ] Add missing users/groups
- [ ] Change insecure passwords
- [ ] Remove prohibited software
- [ ] Lock down browser  
      If the browser is Firefox, basically just set every setting
      to the most strict in the security settings
