# Windows Checklist

Currently applies to both Windows 10 and Windows Server.

> **Note**  
> I haven't actually used Windows 10 or Server during CyberPatriot,
> so the scripts and checklists are almost definitely incomplete.  
> Feel free to make issues or PR's/MR's (preferably through GitLab)
> to improve things.
