# Windows Checklist

Currently applies to both Windows 10 and Windows Server.

> **Note**  
> I haven't actually used Windows 10 or Server during CyberPatriot,
> so the scripts and checklists are almost definitely incomplete.  
> Feel free to make issues or PR's/MR's (preferably through GitLab)
> to improve things.

## Not Managed By Script

- [ ] Remove prohibited/unwanted software

       If the browser is Firefox, basically just set every setting
      to the most strict in the security settings
- [ ] Install recommended programs
